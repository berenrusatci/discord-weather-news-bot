## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to run the bot on your own server.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  - [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher.
  - A Discord account and administrator permissions on a server where you want to add the bot.

### 2\. Clone the Project

Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-bot-project.git
cd discord-bot-project
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project's Python dependencies.

**Contents of `requirements.txt`:**

```
discord.py
python-dotenv
requests
```

Then, install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Obtain API Keys and Bot Token

The bot requires three keys/tokens to function:

1.  **Discord Bot Token:**

      - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
      - Click "New Application" to create a new application.
      - Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot".
      - **IMPORTANT:** In the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section, enable the **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**. This is necessary for the bot to read messages.
      - Click "Reset Token" to get your bot's token and copy it to a safe place.

2.  **WeatherAPI Key:**

      - Sign up at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx).
      - After logging in, get your free API key from your dashboard.

3.  **NewsAPI Key:**

      - Register at [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/register).
      - After logging in, you will be provided with your unique API key.

### 5\. Create the Configuration File

In the project's root directory, create a file named `.env` and paste your keys into it as follows:

```env
TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_WEATHERAPI_KEY_HERE
NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE
```

### 6\. Launch the Bot

Once everything is set up, run the following command in your terminal to start the bot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

*(Note: This assumes your Python file is named `bot.py`.)*

If you see the message `Logged in as YOUR_BOT_NAME!` in the terminal, your bot is successfully online.
